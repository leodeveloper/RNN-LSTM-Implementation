# RNN and LSTM Implementation for Sentence Word Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sentence word prediction. The models are designed to predict the next word in a sentence based on the given input sequence.

## Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are powerful tools for sequential data tasks, such as natural language processing. This project demonstrates how to use these models to predict the next word in a sentence, leveraging the ability of RNNs and LSTMs to maintain context over sequences.
